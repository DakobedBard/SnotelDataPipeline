### Install the Debezium connector then restart the connect container
docker exec -it connect bash
confluent-hub install debezium/debezium-connector-postgresql:0.9.4
docker-compose restart connect

Use the utility script to add the connector
- bash scripts/post.sh snowpack.json
Verify that the connector has been sucessfuly added by consuming the topic, using the utility script included or use another consumer.
If the connector has worked than there will be trip reports in the topic
-bash scripts/consumer.sh db.snowpack.trip_reports

### Add the ElasticSearch sink connector
bash scripts/post.sh es.json
### Verify that ES is getting populated
bash scripts/queryES.sh db.snowpack.trip_reports



Delete an index from ES
curl localhost:29200/delete/db.snowpack.trip_reports/

View the mapping for an index in ES
curl  localhost:29200/db.snowpack.trip_reports/_mapping | jq
Do I still have a mapping if I have ignore shema as True?
